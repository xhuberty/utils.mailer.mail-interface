Mouf Mail system
================

The Mouf framework is only an IOC framework. As such, it does not provide any means for managing any kind of cache. Hopefully,
the Mouf team provides also a range of packages to manage sending mails.

The mail architecture
---------------------

In Mouf, <em>emails</em> are sent using <em>MailServices</em>.<br/>
Mouf provides 4 implementations of mail services. You can provide your own if you want.


By default, Mouf provides these 4 implementations:

- <b>SmtpMailService</b>: a mail service that uses a SMTP server to send mails (this is a wrapper using the Zend_Mail library). It 
  is available in the package <em>utils/mailer/smtp-mail-service</em>.
- <b>SimpleMailService</b>: a mail service that uses the PHP <code>mail</code> function to send mails. It 
  is available in the package <em>utils/mailer/simple-mail-service</em>.
- <b>DBMailService</b>: a mail service that does not send any mails. Instead, it writes the mail in a MySQL database. It 
  can forward the mail later to another mail service that will actually send the mail. This mail server is available in the 
  package <em>utils/mailer/db-mail-service</em>.
- <b>NullMailService</b>: a mail service that does not send any mails. This is useful to disable the sending of mails when developing an application. It 
  is available in the package <em>utils/mailer/null-mail-service</em>.

Each mail service must extend the <code>MailServiceInterface</code> interface that is part of the
package utils/mailer/mail-interface.

The mail service interface
--------------------------

Each class implementing the <code>MailServiceInterface</code> provides one simple method to send mails:
```php
interface MailServiceInterface {
	
	/**
	 * Sends the mail passed in parameter.
	 *
	 * @param MailInterface $mail The mail to send.
	 */
	function send(MailInterface $mail);
}
```

The mail passed in parameter must implement the <code>MailInterface</code> interface. Hopefully, Mouf provides a <code>Mail</code> class
that does just that!

For instance, to send a mail, you just need to write:

```php
$mailService = Mouf::getSmtpMailService();

$mail = new Mail();
$mail->setBodyText("This is my mail!");
$mail->setBodyHtml("This is my &lt;b&gt;mail&lt;/b&gt;!");
$mail->setFrom(new MailAddress("my@server.com", "Server"));
$mail->addToRecipient(new MailAddress("david@email.com", "David"));
$mail->setTitle("My mail");

$mailService->send($mail);
```

The code above assumes that you configured an instance in Mouf called "smtpMailService".

The <code>MailInterface</code> interface supports:

- Text/Html mails (<code>setBodyText</code> and <code>setBodyHtml</code> methods)
- Multiple recipients (<code>addToRecipient</code> method)
- Multiple Cc recipients (<code>addCcRecipient</code> method)
- Multiple Bcc recipients (<code>addBccRecipient</code> method)
- File attachments (<code>addAttachment</code> method)

Mail addresses are passed as a <code>MailAddress</code> object, that contains 2 strings: the mail address and the alias.
